# Babel's Library

>The universe (which others call the Library) is composed of an indefinite, perhaps infinite number of hexagonal galleries…The 
>arrangement of the galleries is always the same: Twenty bookshelves, five to each side, line four of the hexagon's six sides…each 
>bookshelf holds thirty-two books identical in format; each book contains four hundred ten pages; each page, forty lines; each line, 
>approximately eighty black letters

This program implements, in C#, the Babel's Library and generates all its books through backtracking.

- Input the page length (in chars) you desire to generate.
- Input the alphabet (in a string format) you wish to use.
- Input the path you wish to store the result.

The program will create a folder per each hexagon, side and bookshelf.

Enjoy!
